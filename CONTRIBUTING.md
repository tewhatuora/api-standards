# Contributing

Welcome and thank you! We appreciate your interest in contributing. We strongly encourage community contributors because we believe it is only by working together that the Standards will evolve to better meet the needs of our community.

Please note we have code of conduct, and we ask you to follow these guidelines in all your interactions with the project.

If you have a suggestion that you think would make the Standards better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue using one of the templates provided. Refer to [participating](/community/get-involved/03.1-participating) for other ways to get involved.

## Creating a pull request (PR)

To create a pull request

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/enhancement`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some enhancement'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/enhancement`)
5. Open a Pull Request, using the appropriate template, when you think your change is ready for wider community discussion.
6. When you think your PR is ready to be merged, add the `sof-agenda` label. This will ensure the Standards Oversight Forum will consider your PR for inclusion in the Standards.

It’s important to make sure your changes don’t break the existing project so test them as best you can. Refer to the project's README file for details.

## What happens after you submit your PR

Generally speaking, one of the following will happen after you submit your pull request:

### You don't get a response

You can expect a response within 7 days. If you haven't heard anything by then, feel free to post a follow-up on the PR.

### Someone comments on your PR

It’s expected that that community members will ask questions and provide a new perspective on your idea. The whole point of raising a PR is to start a conversation with the community, with the goal of resolving the problem in a way that works for the entire community.

### Someone suggests changes

It’s common that you’ll be asked to make changes to your PR. When someone requests changes, be responsive.

### Your contribution doesn’t get accepted

Once your PR has been well reviewed by the community, you should add the 'sof-agenda' label to your PR. This will trigger the Standards Oversight Forum (SOF) to consider your PR and decide when to include your changes in the Standards. Your contribution may or may not be accepted by the SOF.

If you’re not sure why it wasn’t accepted, it’s perfectly reasonable to ask the SOF members for feedback and clarification. Ultimately, however, you’ll need to respect that this is their decision.

### Your contribution gets accepted

When the SOF accepts your PR, they will merge it and your changes will shortly be reflected in the [working draft version](https://apistandards.digital.health.nz/draft). All going well, your change will also be incorporated into the next [published version](https://apistandards.digital.health.nz) of the Standards.
