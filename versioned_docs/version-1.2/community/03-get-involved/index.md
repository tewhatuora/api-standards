title: Getting Involved
---

If you’re new to the community, just getting started can be intimidating.

When you are first using the Standards, you might find a broken link or a typo or notice something is broken. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, see whether you can help out by creating an issue highlighting the error you've identified. Voilà - you're participating!

The more active the community, the more likely it is that the Standards will rapidly evolve in a direction to suit the community's needs.

So get involved and stay involved!
