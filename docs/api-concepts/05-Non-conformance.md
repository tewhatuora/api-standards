title: Non-Conformance
---

The API Standards are set at the standard the health sector should be operating at. However, due to the reality of the environment, there is a known deficiency in some of the existing products and services. The approach of these API standards is to keep them at the higher level and document the non-conformance and path to conformance.

## Non-comformance process

Non-conformance **MUST** be documented for API Consumers and API Producers of the Digital Services Hub where applicable.

Digital Services Hub maintains a register of non-conformance.

The registers includes:
- A list of standards that aren't met
- Any compensating controls
- Outline a path to resolution

The grace period of non-conformance is 24 months from entering the register. This is to accommodate large changes that may be required to achieve conformance e.g. architecture, or technology changes.
