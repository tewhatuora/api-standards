title: Non-Conformance
---

The API Standards are set at the standard the health sector should be operating at. However, due to the reality of the environment, there is a known deficiency in some of the existing products and services. The approach of these API standards is to keep them at the higher level and document the non-conformance and path to conformance.

## Non-comformance process

Non-conformance **MUST** be documented for API Consumers and API Producers of the Digital Services Hub where applicable.

Digital Services Hub maintains a register of non-conformance:
Documentation includes:
- Submitting A register of services and their conformance is maintained
- For non-conformant services, include a list of standards that aren't met
- List any compensating controls
- Outline a path to resolution
- Define a grace period of non-conformance. Proposal is for 24 months to accommodate large changes in architecture that may be required to achieve conformance.
