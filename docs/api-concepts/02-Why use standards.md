When there are standards, it means that people in the industry/sector have got together and thought about the question: “What is the best way to do this?”.
Standards related to in the industry/sector are developed and agreed so that everyone that wants to develop supplies, products, processes, and services has the same references, tools, agreed languages and taxonomy.

## Benefits

Widespread adoption and use of standards:

- Allows technology to work seamlessly.
- Establishes a common language to measure and evaluate performance.
- Means powerful agreements don’t just span local regions but are internationally accepted and enable commonality and consistency.
- Ensures that organisations are not creating bespoke or proprietary technologies.
- Makes the interoperability of components developed by different companies possible.
- Protects health consumers by raising industry best practices that emphasise safety and quality control.

The best standards are:

- Focused on people
- Supportable
- Appropriate
- Adaptive to present and future needs.

## Outcomes

People are empowered by evidence-based standards that have explicit expectations embedded into them to change their behaviour and practices to achieve better quality outcomes, including:

- Partnering with patients and whanau.
- Working with partner agencies, health providers, Hauora Māori groups, clinical and consumer groups, the health software industry, overseas jurisdictions, and international organisations.
- Committing to the five Te Tiriti principles of tino rangatiratanga, equity, active protection, options and partnership set out by the [Waitangi Tribunal Health Services and Outcomes Inquiry (Wai 2575)](https://waitangitribunal.govt.nz/inquiries/kaupapa-inquiries/health-services-and-outcomes-inquiry/) and [Te Whatu Ora’s Te Tiriti Framework](https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/whakamaua-tiriti-o-waitangi-framework-a3-aug20.pdf).
- Encouraging environmental sustainability and meeting climate resilience priorities.
