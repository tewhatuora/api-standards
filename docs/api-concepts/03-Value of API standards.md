The full potential of the technology is reached when everyone is aligned with the standards, therefore everyone must work together on standards.

The [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/) (WHO) has agreed that standards are needed and has established the global minimum health data standards. These have been adopted and applied at national level at Te Whatu Ora.

The safe, accurate and effective exchange of health data and information is a fundamental foundation to improving healthcare in New Zealand and around the world.

## Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO)

HISO:

- Is Te Whatu Ora’s longstanding kaitiaki (steward) for data and digital standards in the health and disability system.
- Is a committee operated by Te Whatu Ora and accountable to the Chief of Data and Digital.
- Is responsible for determining the standards that have national effect and monitoring the adoption of these standards.
- Oversees the selection, development and adoption of data and digital standards for the health sector.

See Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO) for information on:

- Its role
- How it operates both nationally and internationally
- The work that it does
- Its responsibilities
- The HISO committee.

## Existing standards

Below are some of the most well-known standards:

- [HISO 10008:2015 Pathology and Radiology Messaging Standard](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Our-health-system/Digital-health/Health-information-standards/hiso-10008-2-2015-path-and-rads-messaging-standard-nov-2021.docx)
- [HISO 10029:2022 Health Information Security Framework](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/publications/health-information-security-framework/)
- [HISO 10046:2023 Consumer Health Identity Standard](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/publications/hiso-100462023-consumer-health-identity-standard/)

## Health Information Security Framework

In 2023, work with the national cybersecurity uplift programme resulted in a new and completely revised edition of the Health Information Security Framework being published.
The [Health Information Security Framework](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/publications/health-information-security-framework/) is a common set of standards for the whole health system that supports:

- A data-driven health system.
- Secure and interoperable software.
- A connected health workforce.
- Empowering consumers and whānau.

## Alignment with the Interoperability roadmap

Interoperability is positioned as one of the digital health ecosystem’s central enablers, given effect through standards, guidelines, and resources for interoperability. As kaitiaki of data and digital standards for the health and disability system, HISO will set the standards needed and promote their adoption.

To meet this challenge and put interoperability into practice, an interoperability roadmap has been developed with input from clinical, industry and community stakeholders, using workshops, consultation, and research.

The interoperability roadmap:

- Explains the shift to a fully interoperable digital health ecosystem, and how the shift can be accelerated.
- Outlines the need for change and set out a series of practical steps to be implemented over the next two years.
- Has four interwoven themes:
    - Connecting and identifying
    - Using the same languages
    - Unblocking access to data
    - Enabling joined-up services.
- Describes the leading role that HISO plays in determining the standards needed and charting their adoption.

For the full details, see the [HISO 10083:2020 Interoperability Roadmap](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Our-health-system/Digital-health/Health-information-standards/hiso-10083-2020-interoperability-roadmap-11sept2020.pdf).
