Welcome to our API Design and Development Standards. The intent of this section is to provide you with the high level introductory concepts that will be used throughout these standards.

## Scope
This section contains the business context for API standards and their use within Te Whatu Ora. It describes the value of API standards when promoting innovation in the health sector.

## Target audience
This section is aimed at technical and non-technical people who are developing, or planning to develop, software for the health sector including:
- [API Providers](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-producer)
- [API Consumers](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer)
- [API Developers](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-developers)
- [Application Developers](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#application-developers)

## Definitons
### API
An API is an interface that allows a software application to communicate with another software application. Usually, the communication protocol of APIs is agnostic, but the APIs examined here are either:
- Web APIs, or
- APIs accessed via the http(s) protocol.

:::tip[Info]
An API should not be confused with a service. Whilst web services are APIs, not all APIs are web services. In this context, web APIs that support interoperability are relevant and not software engineering principles.

### Interoperability
Digital health can transform the outcomes and experience of health consumers if information is shared seamlessly. When digital products, services and information systems work together in this way, it is called being interoperable.
Interoperability is a key enabler of the digital health ecosystem Te Whatu Ora is building. Interoperability will ensure that health information can be accessed by health consumers, health workers, and whānau:
- Anywhere
- Anytime
- Anyhow.

### Standards
A standard is a documented set of the following items that when used consistently ensure that the supplies, products, processes, and services developed are fit for purpose and aligned with others in the same sector:
- Requirements
- Specifications
- Agreed terms, rules, and definitions
- Guidelines
- Characteristics

Standards can be compulsory when referenced in Acts, regulations, or other legislative instruments.

## Why use standards?
When there are standards, it means that people in the industry/sector have got together and thought about the question: “What is the best way to do this?”.
Standards related to in the industry/sector are developed and agreed so that everyone that wants to develop supplies, products, processes, and services has the same references, tools, agreed languages and taxonomy.

### Benefits
Widespread adoption and use of standards:
- Allows technology to work seamlessly.
- Establishes a common language to measure and evaluate performance.
- Means powerful agreements don’t just span local regions but are internationally accepted and enable commonality and consistency.
- Ensures that organisations are not creating bespoke or proprietary technologies.
- Makes the interoperability of components developed by different companies possible.
- Protects health consumers by raising industry best practices that emphasise safety and quality control.

The best standards are:
- Focused on people
- Supportable
- Appropriate
- Adaptive to present and future needs.

### Outcomes

People are empowered by evidence-based standards that have explicit expectations embedded into them to change their behaviour and practices to achieve better quality outcomes, including:
- Partnering with patients and whanau.
- Working with partner agencies, health providers, Hauora Māori groups, clinical and consumer groups, the health software industry, overseas jurisdictions, and international organisations.
- Committing to the five Te Tiriti principles of tino rangatiratanga, equity, active protection, options and partnership set out by the [Waitangi Tribunal Health Services and Outcomes Inquiry (Wai 2575)](https://waitangitribunal.govt.nz/inquiries/kaupapa-inquiries/health-services-and-outcomes-inquiry/) and [Te Whatu Ora’s Te Tiriti Framework](https://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/pages/whakamaua-tiriti-o-waitangi-framework-a3-aug20.pdf).
- Encouraging environmental sustainability and meeting climate resilience priorities.

## Value of API standards

The full potential of the technology is reached when everyone is aligned with the standards, therefore everyone must work together on standards.

The [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/) (WHO) has agreed that standards are needed and has established the global minimum health data standards. These have been adopted and applied at national level at Te Whatu Ora.

The safe, accurate and effective exchange of health data and information is a fundamental foundation to improving healthcare in New Zealand and around the world.

### Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO)

HISO:
- Is Te Whatu Ora’s longstanding kaitiaki (steward) for data and digital standards in the health and disability system.
- Is a committee operated by Te Whatu Ora and accountable to the Chief of Data and Digital.
- Is responsible for determining the standards that have national effect and monitoring the adoption of these standards.
- Oversees the selection, development and adoption of data and digital standards for the health sector.
See Health Information Standards Organisation (HISO) for information on:
- Its role
- How it operates both nationally and internationally
- The work that it does
- Its responsibilities
- The HISO committee.

### Existing standards

Below are some of the most well-known standards:
- [HISO 10008:2015 Pathology and Radiology Messaging Standard](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Our-health-system/Digital-health/Health-information-standards/hiso-10008-2-2015-path-and-rads-messaging-standard-nov-2021.docx)
- [HISO 10029:2022 Health Information Security Framework](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/publications/health-information-security-framework/)
- [HISO 10046:2023 Consumer Health Identity Standard](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/publications/hiso-100462023-consumer-health-identity-standard/)

### Health Information Security Framework

In 2023, work with the national cybersecurity uplift programme resulted in a new and completely revised edition of the Health Information Security Framework being published.
The [Health Information Security Framework](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/publications/health-information-security-framework/) is a common set of standards for the whole health system that supports:
- A data-driven health system.
- Secure and interoperable software.
- A connected health workforce.
- Empowering consumers and whānau.

### Alignment with the Interoperability roadmap
Interoperability is positioned as one of the digital health ecosystem’s central enablers, given effect through standards, guidelines, and resources for interoperability. As kaitiaki of data and digital standards for the health and disability system, HISO will set the standards needed and promote their adoption.

To meet this challenge and put interoperability into practice, an interoperability roadmap has been developed with input from clinical, industry and community stakeholders, using workshops, consultation, and research.

The interoperability roadmap:
- Explains the shift to a fully interoperable digital health ecosystem, and how the shift can be accelerated.
- Outlines the need for change and set out a series of practical steps to be implemented over the next two years.
- Has four interwoven themes:
- Connecting and identifying
- Using the same languages
- Unblocking access to data
- Enabling joined-up services.
- Describes the leading role that HISO plays in determining the standards needed and charting their adoption.
For the full details, see the [HISO 10083:2020 Interoperability Roadmap](https://www.tewhatuora.govt.nz/assets/Our-health-system/Digital-health/Health-information-standards/hiso-10083-2020-interoperability-roadmap-11sept2020.pdf).
