:::info
'Canonical' here means well-known (among consumers of a FHIR API).

Many FHIR resource types define a *canonical* URL, also known in FHIR Implementation Guides as *official URL*s, which API consumers can rely on to **permanently identify a resource across all contexts of use**.
:::

FHIR APIs **MUST** use canonical URLs to reference recognised resource instances.  See [Canonical Resource Identity](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/resource.html#canonical) in the FHIR documentation for further information.

Two practical examples where use of a canonical URL is crucial:

1. When a FHIR API consumer is creating a `QuestionnaireResponse` resource instance and needs to identify the `Questionnaire` which defines the standard questions answered by that response.
1. When a FHIR API designer needs to identify a `ValueSet` resource which specifies codes (aka 'terminology') valid for use in some particular situation.

### Requirements for FHIR APIs

1. FHIR API designers **MUST** define and use recognised *canonical URL*s in new definitions (profiles and extensions) and terminology (`CodeSystem`s and `ValueSet`s)

1. Canonical URLs **SHOULD** use a `standards.digital.health.nz` base.

#### Canonical URL naming pattern

| IG artifact type | Official Url naming pattern to use |  
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| `Extension` (StructureDefinition) | `http://standards.digital.health.nz/fhir/StructureDefinition/{{extensionName}}` |
| `CodeSystem` | `http://standards.digital.health.nz/ns/{{CodeSystemName}}` |
| `ValueSet` | `http://nzhts.digital.health.nz/fhir/ValueSet/{{ValueSetName}}` |
