We encourage the Aotearoa health sector to contribute to the development of these standards to ensure the needs of applications producing and / or consuming these FHIR APIs are met.  For more information about how to contribute please see the [collaboration guidelines](/community/Introduction)

### Welcome to the New Zealand FHIR API Design and Development Standards

**Te Whatu Ora is adopting **FHIR**[^1] ([Fast Health Interoperability Resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/index.html)) as a primary data standard for exchanging healthcare information** to build an interoperable health information ecosystem for the NZ health sector.

FHIR APIs [provide](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-producer) convenient persistence and searching of health data representations for [consuming](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer) health software applications.

As FHIR leaves open many choices to implementers, some control is needed in pursuit of interoperability that is beneficial to all parties.  

The Standards here prescribe certain mandatory aspects of FHIR API design and implementation which are mandatory for all FHIR-based APIs published by *Te Whatu Ora*.

There are also Guidelines which provide additional recommendations for designers and implementers.
