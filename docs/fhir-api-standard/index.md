Welcome to our API Design and Development Standards. This section is aimed at Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) API producers and consumers

This section is relevant to you if:

- You are:
  - an [API Producer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-producer)
  - an [API Consumer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer)
  - an [API Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-developers)
  - an [Application Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#application-developers)
- **AND** you re working with FHIR APIs

The intent of this section is to provide you with principles, standards and guidelines that encourage the development of consistent FHIR APIs as well as rules for API consumption.

Please note that if you are one of the above categories but not working with FHIR APIs then you may also be interested in the [API Design and Development Standards](/api-development)
