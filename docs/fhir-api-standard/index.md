Welcome to our API Design and Development Standards. This section is aimed at API Producers and Consumers of HL7 Fast Health Care Resources (FHIR) APIs.

This section is relevant to you if:

- You are:
  - an [API Producer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-provider)
  - an [API Consumer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer)
  - an [API Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-developers)
  - an [Application Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#application-developers)
- **AND** you re working with FHIR APIs

The intent of this section is to provide you with principles, standards and guidelines that encourage the development of consistent FHIR APIs as well as rules for API consumption.

:::info[FHIR API Security]
The FHIR specification itself is not a security protocol nor does it define any security related functionality - it suggests the use of a security sub-system that performs user authentication and authorization. For information on API security in these standards please refer to [API Security](../api-security)

Please note that if you are one of the above categories but not working with FHIR APIs then you may also be interested in the [API Design and Development Standards](/api-development)
