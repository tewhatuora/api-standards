title: Measuring

Data, when used wisely, can help the Standards Oversight Forum (SOF) and moderators make better decisions.

With more information, you can:

- Understand how the community responds to the Standards
- Track trends in activity within your community
- Quantify the popularity of the Standards
- Understand how the Standards are used within the community
- and much more.

There are two sources of metrics for the Standards: the website and the GitHub repository.

For information on how to obtain metrics from GitHub, refer to [viewing activity and data for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository).

The following metrics should be gathered from both:

- Total page views: Tells you how many times your project was viewed
- Total unique visitors: Tells you how many people viewed the Standards
- Referring sites: Tells you where visitors came from. This metric can help you figure out where to reach your audience.
- Popular content: Tells you where visitors go on your project, and where you should (or should not) be focussing your efforts.

Additional metrics should be obtained from GitHub to identify and track trends in community activity:

- Number of clones: Provides information about active community members and likely contributors
- Total contributor count and number of commits per contributor: Tells you how many contributors you have, and who’s more or less active.
- First time, casual, and repeat contributors: Helps you track whether you’re getting new contributors, and whether they come back.
- Number of open issues and open pull requests: If these numbers get too high, you might need help with issue triaging and moderation.
- Number of opened issues and opened pull requests: Opened issues means somebody cares enough about your project to open an issue. If that number increases over time, it suggests people are interested in your project.
- Types of contributions: For example, commits or comments.
- As the community grows, metrics should also be gathered about moderator and Standards Oversight Forum activities, too.
