Welcome to our API Design and Development Standards. This section is aimed at API Providers and consumers

This section is relevant to you if:

- You are an [API Provider](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-producer)
- You are an [API Consumer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer)
- You are an [API Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-developers)
- You are an [Application Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#application-developers)

The intent of this section is to provide you with detailed standards to assist you in the development of consistent APIs as well as rules for API consumption.

Please note that if you are one of the above categories but working with FHIR APIs you may also be interested in the [FHIR API standards](/fhir-api-standard)
