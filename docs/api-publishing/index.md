Welcome to our API Publishing Standards. This section is aimed at API Providers.

This section is relevant to you if:

- You are an [API Provider](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-provider)
- You are an [API Consumer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer)
- You are an [API Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-developers)
- You are an [Application Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#application-developers)

The intent of this section is to provide API Providers with detailed standards to assist you when publishing APIs. It should also act as a guide for API Consumers when discovering published APIs.

Please note that if you are one of the above categories but working with FHIR APIs you may also be interested in the [FHIR API standards](/fhir-api-standard)
