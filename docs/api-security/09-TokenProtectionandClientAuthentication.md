## Client Authentication Standards

The role of Client Authentication in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is to help maintain the integrity and security of the authentication flow. Its objective is to enure that only authorised API Consumers can interact with API Providers.

All MEDICAL IN-CONFIDENCE APIs **SHOULD** be secured using Client Authentication to protect the token endpoint and tokens issued **MUST** be bound to the client.

There are three authentication models that can be applied to secure the Confidential Client connection from the API Consumer to the API Provider's token endpoint.

- Shared Client Secret
- JWT Based Authentication
- Private Key JWT

## Shared Client Secret Method

An API Consumer creates a client with an API Provider and they are issued with a Client ID and a Client Secret.

### Client ID

This is used when the API Consumer interacts with the API Provider. Used on both the authorise and token endpoint.

### Client Secret

This is used with the Client ID when exchanging a code for an access token on the token endpoint of the API Provider Server.

Shared Client secrets have to stored by both the API Consumer and API Provider. There are two Share Client secret methods:

### client_secret_basic

This model uses the HTTP Basic authentication scheme, and the client ID and client secret are encoded (Base 64). An example of a call to the token endpoint is shown below where the secret is presented in the header.

<!-- cspell:disable -->

      ```json
      POST /token
      Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0Mzo3RmpmcDBaQnIxS3REUmJuZlZkbUl3
      Content_Type: application/x-www-form-urlenclosed
      ```
**MAY** be used for UNCLASSIFIED APIs.
**SHOULD NOT** be used for MEDICAL IN-CONFIDENCE APIs.
**SHOULD NOT** be used with Public Clients.
Confidential clients **MUST** securely store these credentials.

### client_secret_post

This sends the client ID and secret within a POST body so it is percieved as a more secure process than client_secret_basic.

<!-- cspell:disable -->
      ```json
      POST /Token
      Content_Type: application/x-www-form-urlenclosed
      client_id=cccc
      &client_secret=xxxxx
      ```

<!-- cspell:enable -->

**COULD** be used for UNCLASSIFIED APIs.
**SHOULD NOT** be used for MEDICAL IN-CONFIDENCE APIs.
**SHOULD NOT** be used with Public Clients.
Confidential clients **MUST** securely store these credentials.

## JWT based Authentication Methods

There are two JWT authentication methods which provide a higher level of security over client_secret_basic and client_secret_post.

### client_secret_jwt

This method still requires a client ID and Client secret to be managed but the client secret does not get sent during the authentication process and the body of the JWT contains an expiry time for the token.

The API Consumer creates the JWT and embeds the client ID in the body of the token. The client secret is then used to calculate the JWT signature.

<!-- cspell:disable -->

      ```json
      POST /token HTTP/1.1
      Host: as.example.com
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      grant_type=authorization_code
      &code=Gw30fMKJBHkcOBSde5awLrMm4ahvgCNM2cFSTUOUflY
      &redirect_uri=https://halth.govt.nz/redirection
      &client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&
      &client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.ewogICJqd.......
      ```
<!-- cspell:enable -->

**COULD** be used for UNCLASSIFIED APIs.
**SHOULD NOT** be used for MEDICAL IN-CONFIDENCE APIs.
**SHOULD NOT** be used with Public Clients.
**SHOULD** be used with Confidential Clients.

### Mutual TLS Method

There are two methods:

- **self_signed_tls_client_auth**

      A self-signed client X509 certificate is used to authenticate the client.

- **tls_client_auth**

      A client X509 certificate that has been issued from a trusted certificate authority is used to authenticate the client.

Both add security enhancement as they use mTLS creating a two way trust between the API Consumer and API Provider but add complexity to the design.

self_signed_tls_client_auth **MAY** be used in Testing and Development environments they **SHOULD NOT** be used in production implementations.

tls_client_auth **COULD** be used in a production implementation and **COULD** be used in a confidential client.

Public clients **SHOULD NOT** use either of these authentication methods.

## Private Key JWT Method

This method does not use a client secret, it utilises a shared secret between the API Consumer and the API Provider.

It relies on asymmetric cryptography, where the API Consumer holds both a private key for signing and a public key for verification.

The public key is registered with the API Provider, allowing it to validate the JWT signed by the API Consumer's private key.

This is a less complex solution that tls_client_auth.

<!-- cspell:disable -->

Private Key JWT

      ```json
      POST /token HTTP/1.1
      Host: [www.holder.com.au]
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      grant_type=client_credentials&
      client_id=5ntwEOpMdPxxy49Gt28SXWY6j3afl2CP2&
      scope=admin%3Ametrics.basic%3Aread&
      client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&
      client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJQUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IjEyNDU2In0.ey ...
      ```
<!-- cspell:enable -->

This **SHOULD** be used when protecting MEDICAL IN-CONFIDENCE APIs via a confidential client

**SHOULD NOT** be used with Public Clients

## Token Protection

One of the big risks with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is token theft, where an access token is captured and used to obtain information from an API Provider's protected resource.

OpenID Connect provides a mechanism of demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) that strengthens the client authentication and helps to verify that the access token belongs to the API Consumer client. It:

- Links the access token to the client
- The client presenting the access token has to provide proof of possession of the Access token and the identity of the client to the resource server
- The proof of possession is linked to a cryptographic key.

There are two DPoP methods defined by OpenID Connect.

### JWK-based Proof of Possession

- API Consumer generates a public-private key pair
- The API Consumer generates a `DPoP` JWT which contains the public key and signed with the private key
- When the API Consumer requests an access token from the API Provider's token endpoint it includes the `DPoP` jwt in the request header
- The JWT access token returned includes `token_type = DPoP` to signify the access token is not a bearer token and is bound to the API Consumer's key by embedding 
- The API Consumer sends the JWT access token to the API Provider resource server with another `DPoP` header and `Authorization` header
- The API provider validates the `DPoP` header and `DPoP`-bound access token in the `Authorization`.

### Certificate-based Proof of Possession

- The API Consumer initiates and established mTLS with the API Provider when it requests the access token
- The API Provider validates the API Consumers certificate
- The API Provider issues the access token with additional claims  (hash of the API Consumers certificate)
- The API Provider resource server receives the access token and validates the token and the client certificate and if correct responds to the API Consumer

Certificate-based proof of possession has a higher level of security than the JWT PoP as it includes mTLS.

When protecting MEDICAL IN-CONFIDENCE APIs a DPoP model **COULD** be used.

Selection of the certificate or the JWT PoP **SHOULD** be based on a risk assessment taking into account the sensitivity of the information being exposed by the API.
