Welcome to our API Design and Development Standards. This section is aimed at API Providers and consumers

This section is relevant to you if:

- You are an [API Provider](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-producer)
- You are an [API Consumer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-consumer)
- You are an [API Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#api-developers)
- You are an [Application Developer](/api-concepts/ComponentDefinitions#application-developers)

The intent of this section is to provide you with detailed standards to assist you in building and publishing secure APIs as well rules for API consumption.
