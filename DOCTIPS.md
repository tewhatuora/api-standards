# Documentation Tips

The following tips ant tricks are to assist you when contributing to this repo.

## Markdown Tips

Markdown is a simple language that can be converted to stylised HTML content to be rendered on a web page. There are a number of tips [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to get you started.

## Diagrams as Code

The preference in this repo is to produce diagrams as code. The tooling that we are using utilises [plantuml](https://plantuml.com) as the primary diagramming tool. The preference is for these diagrams to be included inline in the markdown.

When creating plantuml diagrams there are a number of examples already in the repository and you will find a bunch of snippets [here](./plantuml)
